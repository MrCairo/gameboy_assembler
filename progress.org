Working on the assembly of code.
Mostly working. Much is parsing correctly. Some thing don't work yet:

** Forward reference aren't supported
Symbols and Labels need to be defined first in order to be resolved. They can be resolved late but it could cause a problem in determining instruction size.

*** Should there be a pre-processor step?

** [] or () on Instructions
The existing JSON extract of the mnemonics use () for things like ~ld a, (hl)~. RGBD uses ~[ ]~ characters instead. Should they both be supported or just one?
